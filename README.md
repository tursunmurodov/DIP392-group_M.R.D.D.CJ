```bash
venv\Scripts\activate  #  on Windows
source venv/bin/activate # on Linux
```
To install requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then type :
```bash
python main.py
```

Create the .env file (as the example .env.example) and add real credentials.


To start the backend server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
``` 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
